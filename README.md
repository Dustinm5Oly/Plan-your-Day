# Plan-your-Day
plan your day by hour

## This webpage to plan your day by the hour and save any plans for that day!

    -My motivation was to use bootstrap, jQuery and JS to allow a user to plan their day out.
    -I built this project so I will be able understand how Jquery is used and be able to use bootstrap to make custom styles easier to use without creating my own.
    -The webpage allowed the user to plan their day out while keeping in mind the time with change of color when the hour is passed current or coming.
    -I learned how to use Jquery to make my life easier by selecting all elements that are associate on an html element without creating variable arrays through js. I also learned how to apply classes through bootstrap to style my webpage. As well as use local storage to continue to display text after refreshing the page.
